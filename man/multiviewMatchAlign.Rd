\title{Rotational alignment of latent factors and loading matrices}
\usage{
multiviewMatchAlign(risMCMC)
}
\arguments{
\item{risMCMC}{Posterior samples, as returned by \code{\link{gibbs_jafar}} or \code{\link{gibbs_jfr}}.}
}
\value{
A modified version of the input \code{risMCMC}, with latent factors, loading matrices,
and response loadings (if supervised) rotated according to multi-view \code{MatchAlign}.
}
\description{
Post-processing routine to solve rotational ambiguity across MCMC samples of latent variables.
The alignment is performed using multi-view \code{MatchAlign} on the shared component and regular \code{MatchAlign} on the specific ones.
